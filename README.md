# Crosshair-Design-Effects-on-Accuracy-and-Visual-Comfort-in-FPS-Games
This study investigates how crosshair attributes (shape, size, colour) influence shooting accuracy and visual comfort in first person shooters (FPS). A short online survey (N = 6) collected demographic data, crosshair usage, and perceived effects on aim and eye strain. Results show most participants use custom crosses or dots, favouring cyan or yellow for visibility, and report that appropriate crosshairs improve aim accuracy and reduce discomfort (e.g., “Better visibility”, “Better aim”). A literature review links these findings to prior work on visual guides enhancing performance and the role of eye movement efficiency in expert shooters as well as the reliability of aim training metrics. Every participant concurred that a universally perfect crosshair does not exist, highlighting the necessity for customizable UI systems. This research provides initial insights into crosshair design as a relevant interface element in HCI and highlights design factors for enhancing usability, visual ergonomics, and the overall player experience. Suggestions for future controlled experiments are examined.
